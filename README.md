GTM Website Page Status Variable.

This variable returns a string of __"Status Error"__ or __"Status OK"__ based on the page title. The __"Status Error"__ will only be returned if your page title contains __"Page not found"__ or __"404"__.

The script can be modified to accept other error messages that could potentially show in the page title.
